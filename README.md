#About 

This is a sample project for demonstrating how to use firebase and angular together. 
Its basically let users login to system with their social media accounts like facebook or twitter and etc.  

Right now it only supports facebook for logins, but soon other platforms will be added

All login and chat stuff happens on client side but I had to use NodeJS and ExpressJS for routing and other stuffs.

#Set up instructions
Those instructions are all mentioned on firebase website. I will try to summarize it. 
For detailed information please take a look at firebase documenation. 

#Facebook instruction
1. You have to sign in to firebase and get your firebase url.
2. Then you need to have create an app with your fb account

You will have to get a valid API key from Facebook. 
Get one on [Facebook API]. 

#Installation
1. npm install
2. node app.js
3. Open your browser and load the URL http://localhost:8080



# TODO
